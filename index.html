April 18, 2016 / By NomadicMatt

Photography of the coast of Sydney skyline and Opera House
The first time I was in Sydney (all the way back in 2007), I spent most of my days sitting in the botanical gardens, reading a book and looking at the Opera House and Harbour Bridge. For so long I had heard about how wonderful and beautiful Sydney was, and there I was experiencing it! Over the years, I’ve been to the city a handful of times, exploring it more and more and getting a local taste through all my wonderful friends there.

After spending two weeks there last month, I wanted to share my favorite things to do and see in this laid-back, warm, sunny, and gregarious city:</p>


<p class="tekst2"> Explore The Rocks – The Rocks is the oldest part of Sydney. With it narrow lanes, fine colonial buildings, sandstone churches, and Australia’s oldest pubs, this neighborhood is where Sydney started when the British first landed. It was almost torn down in the 1970s for modern high rises, but, luckily, citizen action got it preserved instead. The Rocks’ weekend markets, art museums, street entertainment, delicious (and sometimes overpriced) restaurants, and beautiful views of the harbor, Opera House, and bridge make this is one of the coolest areas of the city. I love heading up to the Sydney Observatory Hill Park for a good view of the city, wandering the harbor promenade, and hitting the bars at night.

			<p class="tekst3"> Hang out at the beach – Sydney is synonymous with its beaches, and the area is also especially famous for having world-class surfing. Since it’s warm and sunny most of the year, the city has a strong beach culture, and on the weekends (and many weekdays for that matter), locals flock to the seashore. From Palm Beach and Manly in the north to the famous Bondi and Coogee in the south, Sydney has a beach for everyone. All the beaches are easy to get to via public transportation or car and there are tons of restaurants and surf shops around, too! My favorite beaches are Manly (wide and beautiful) and Bronte (small and quiet)</p>

				<p class="tekst3"> Learn to surf – Sydney is often the place travelers bite the bullet and learn the art of Australia’s famous national pastime. There are many companies here that offer lessons. While Bondi is the most popular beach, Manly on the north shore of Sydney has better waves (though you can find good waves up and down the coast!).

Wine Tasting in the Hunter Valley – North of town is one of Australia’s premier wine regions. The Hunter Valley is home to amazing wineries that produce luscious reds. While it’s not as easy on the budget, it is an excuse to get out of the city and see the countryside. Day tours are offered from Sydney, but they are expensive ($150-200 AUD) and you spend a lot of time in the bus. Want even more fun? Try a bike tour. Grapemobile and Hunter Valley Cycling offer one-day bicycle rentals starting at $35 AUD. It’s best to stay for at least a night to get the full experience.</p>
